## What I learned

- This was my second project working with Firebase as my BaaS, so I learned more about querying the data and updating the existing user data. I created a scoreboard component which stores and updates the users best score.

- Adding Google log in through Firebase, while the complexity was handled by Firebase's prebuilt methods it was helpful to see the process of handling a user log in and log in state.

## How I could improve moving forward 

- My next step feels like it should be working on a real backend, I feel comfortable with the basics of Firebase now which gave me the backend foundation. The natural next step feels like it should be to integrate a real backend and database like express and MongoDB perhaps.
